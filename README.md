# Bad Bank App
## _Front End Portfolio Project_

Welcome to my front-end project for the MERN stack bootcamp with MITxPro.

- Create an account
- Withdraw and deposit money from a pre-determined account.
- ✨Go to the All Data page to see tracked transactions ✨

## Lessons Learned

- Set up a router for a single-page application
- Created a sign-up form which used a seperate form componenet
- Using context and state to 'save' user creation, withdrawals, and deposits. 

The next steps for this app include login functionality and the ability to manipulate different user accounts.
